# CPU Scheduler

A CPU scheduler is a critical component of an operating system, responsible for managing the execution of processes by determining the order in which processes access the central processing unit (CPU). The primary goal of a CPU scheduler is to optimize CPU utilization, ensuring that the CPU is kept as busy as possible by efficiently allocating time to various processes. Several scheduling algorithms are employed to achieve this, including First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), and Shortest Job Remaining First (SJRF). FCFS schedules processes in the order they arrive, while SJF prioritizes processes with the shortest execution time. RR allocates a fixed time slice to each process in a cyclic order, ensuring fair CPU time distribution, and SJRF, a preemptive version of SJF, interrupts the current process if a shorter job arrives, aiming to minimize the average waiting time. By implementing these algorithms, a CPU scheduler can effectively manage process execution, enhancing overall system performance and responsiveness.
